          <h4>Question #1: Back-end or Front-end developer?</h4>
          <p>At Epicodus, all potential students are encouraged to adopt an understanding that it is not necessarily <em>which</em> track or course you take but "learning how to learn". This means that if you commit to any offered course you build habits that will allow you to learn other computing languages. Keeping this in mind, one of the biggest differences is that of front-end and back-end developers. Front-end developers work on creating the overall look, or design, of a website or application. This might concern the user's experience when visually interacting with the program along with the presentation and orientation. Back-end programmers are more behind the scenes, and concerned with the logic of the applicaiton or website, possibly taking in the user input and manipulating the data.</p>

          <h4>Question #2: Work Preference</h4>
          <p>As Epicodus is a vocational school, its intention is to give you marketable skills that will assist with acquiring a job soon after graduating. With that being said, some languages are utilized more often by larger companies (i.e.,Enterprise) that have been around for a long time and others more often by younger companies (i.e., smaller startups). Please note that this is absolutely not a hard rule, many companies deploy multiple types of technologies with their websites, applications, and programs. It is very likely that if you took one track through Epicodus that the company that hires you may want you to learn another.</p>
